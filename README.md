# Mixed-DWR_Example
This is an example of the multiple-implementation of Dual weighted residual methods based adaptive FEM framewok.
It is implemented based on the AFEPack library. To make it easier to be understood, some template class are defined in float and double precision, respectively.
In fact, with a higher version AFEPack library, this can be implemented more conveniently and smoothly.
